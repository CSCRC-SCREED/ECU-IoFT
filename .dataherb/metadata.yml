description: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly integrated into STEM education, but their cybersecurity vulnerabilities, particularly in low-end consumer drones, are a significant concern. The education sector's awareness of the risks to students and staff is often limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, the ECU-IoFT dataset has been developed, capturing three known cyber-attacks targeting Wi-Fi communications in an affordable drone. This initiative addresses the absence of publicly available, real-world datasets on cyberattacks in the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). The dataset aims to aid cybersecurity researchers and UAV manufacturers in developing stronger defenses and more secure products, with plans to expand its scope to include more attacks and adapt it for big data analysis.
